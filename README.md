###Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Readme.MD

The following describes the purpose of this project and gives and over view of what will be contained in this repo.

###Project Requirements

The data for this project comes from UCI archive.  The zip file to be downloaded (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) contains accelerometer data gathered from Samsung Galaxy Smartphones.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
